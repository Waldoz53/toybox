# Toybox Alpha v2

A Next.js project with a Supabase (Postgres) backend.

Toybox is a site for action figure collectors to log and share their action figure collection publicly.

## To Do:
1. Organize the CSS files better! (its all global right now)
2. Validation on form submit the following: 
  1. User names, emails, passwords, form titles, descriptions, etc
3. Paginate home posts, and then also user profile posts
4. Better error messaging? (sort of there!)
5. Add ratings
6. Create a database of items that people can add, rather than completely custom titles (like how Letterboxd works)
7. Users should be able to like and comment on posts
8. Run an ESLint/Prettier to make sure imports, code, etc is consistently named/typed out

Code marked with "FIX:" somewhere in the source are things I will fix eventually, but aren't necessary in early dev/testing
