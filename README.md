# Toybox Alpha v2

A Next.js project with a Supabase (Postgres) backend.

Toybox is a site for action figure collectors to log and share their action figure collection publicly.

Code marked with "FIX:" somewhere in the source are things I will fix eventually, but aren't necessary in early dev/testing

Theres a todo list of upcoming features and fixes in the page.tsx in /blog.
