# Toybox Alpha v2

A Next.js project with a Supabase (Postgres) backend.

Toybox is a site for action figure collectors to log and share their action figure collection publicly.

## To Do:
1. A lot!
2. Validation on form submit
  1. User names, emails, passwords, form titles, descriptions, etc
3. Show some sort of loading spinner (or other effect) to make sure it doesnt look like the system is hanging
4. Better error messaging?
5. Add ratings
6. Create a database of items that people can add, rather than completely custom titles
